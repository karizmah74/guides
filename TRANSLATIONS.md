# Translations

Like the rest of the project, the Ember Guides translations are maintained and updated by an all-volunteer group of Ember community members. We'd love to have you join our efforts! Here are a few ways you can help

* _Translating content_: You can contribute new translations in order to move that language further along.
* _Reviewing translated content_: You can review existing translations for tone, grammar, and spelling in order to improve them.
* _Adding a new language_: If your language isn't in the list yet, feel free to add it!

To manage the translations we use the CrowdIn platform. You can get an invite to the Ember.js group by [following this link](https://crowdin.com/project/emberjs/invite/public?show_welcome&d=ac4a8bf969cffa45999ad17e8c9868c8469465).
The translations are coordinated through the [#dev-translations](https://embercommunity.slack.com/messages/dev-translations/) channel on the Ember.js Slack group.
